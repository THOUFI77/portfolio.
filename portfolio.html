    This portfolio site was fully designed and developed by me using HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript. <br>
    While it’s a simple structure, it reflects my understanding of layout, responsiveness, and clean UI design. <br>
    I’ve gained solid knowledge through hands-on practice and continue improving every day.
