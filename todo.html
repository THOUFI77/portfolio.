    This was my very first project â€” a To-Do web application built as part of a group project during 
    my full stack development course at Zenecks Info Tech.<br> It helped me understand the basics of task management features, 
    teamwork in development, and how to build functional UIs using core technologies. <br>
    This project marked the beginning of my journey into web development.
