    I developed a modern e-commerce website for a friend who owns a store, 
    which gave me the confidence to build real-world applications. The project uses React, Node.js, Tailwind CSS, Vite, HTML, and CSS 
    — built with support from online resources like Google and YouTube. <br>It was hosted live, 
    but I’ve temporarily paused it as I’m learning to improve and complete it more effectively. <br>
    This project helped me sharpen my skills across both frontend and backend development.
